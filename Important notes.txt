Important notes

by Qi He (Programmer 3)

For both of you:
	The methods I have implanted in my Registration class are:
		Enroll New Student (Returns Boolean to indicate if success, and update seats available in String[] course)

		Get spots Available (Returns integer and prints the spots available)

		Get Registration Detail (TBD, Maybe return course detail and spots available?)

Please, I need your ideas of what I can implant on this class. Don't mind the complexity, I'll deal with it. I can also do the last main java file that interact with user.



For Programmer 1:
	Since I started my part before you did, Please create your array in the following order:
		type: String[]
		course number, number of spots, course name, teacher
	and since "try" method has not been taught, It is not implanted in Registration.java. Please make sure in your class when creating new class object, The inputs are valid.

	If you decide to add more elements that I need to know, Please reach me ASAP.

For Programmer 2:
	Since I started my part before you did, Please create your array in the following order:
		type: String[]
		Student Name, Student Number
	and since "try" method has not been taught, It is not implanted in Registration.java. Please make sure in your class when creating new class object, The inputs are valid.

	If you decide to add more elements that I need to know, Please reach me ASAP.
