# Course-Registration-System

Build a course registration system where students can manage courses and student
enrollments. The system will allow users to add new courses, register students for courses, and
view registration details. This project will provide hands-on experience with object-oriented
programming, control statements, and array handling, as well as the importance of documenting
code with Javadoc.
